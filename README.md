# 📄 Appointment Analysis Summary (COVID Trends)

This repository contains a single PDF file summarizing a data analysis project focused on graduate student advising appointments across different COVID-19 periods (pre-, during, and post-pandemic).

The goal of the analysis was to identify how student engagement with advising services changed over time, both in terms of overall usage rates and program-level behavior.

## 📌 Key Highlights

- 📈 **Usage Rate Trends**  
  Regression modeling reveals that appointment usage peaked during the COVID period, with statistically significant differences compared to pre- and post-COVID eras.

- 🧮 **Program-Level Shifts**  
  A chi-square test shows that the distribution of appointments across programs changed significantly over time, suggesting shifts in advising demand by discipline.

- 🚨 **Outlier Detection**  
  Residual and influence analysis highlights a few programs that behaved unusually during the pandemic, offering insights for further review or targeted support.

## 🔐 Privacy Notice

All data used in this analysis has been fully anonymized. Program names were randomized, and no student identifiers (names, emails, IDs) are included.
